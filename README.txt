The basic ingredients for the previous application are:

1.-HTML: The web page structure and content
2.- CSS: The styling of the web page
3.- Flask: A web framework for Python
4.- Python: The programming language used

Sure, here's the documentation on the above program:

The program is a task management web application that is developed in HTML, CSS, and Python. Use the Flask framework to develop the server logic and provide a web interface for the user.

HTML and CSS:
The page is structured in HTML and styled with CSS. The page structure is divided into a header, a form for adding tasks, and a task list. The form contains two elements: a text box to enter the task and a button to add the task. The task list is designed as an unnumbered list containing list items (li) for each task. Each list item includes a space to display the task text and a button to delete the task.

Flask:
Flask is a Python framework for developing web applications. In this case, Flask is used to provide server logic for the task management application. This includes logic for adding and removing tasks, as well as displaying the current task list. However, the program does not include to save the task list in a persistent storage.

In short, this app is a basic example of a task management app that can be developed using HTML, CSS, and Flask. However, to make it a fully functional application, more logic and features need to be added, such as storing tasks in a database.
